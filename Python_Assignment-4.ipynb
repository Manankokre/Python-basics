What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","  - Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software around objects — units that combine state (data) and behavior (functions/methods). Instead of writing programs as a sequence of procedures, OOP models the program as interacting objects that represent entities from the problem domain (e.g., Car, User, Invoice).\n","\n","    Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n","2. What is a class in OOP?\n","  - A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.  \n","\n","    For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.\n","3. What is an object in OOP?\n","  - It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.\n","\n","    For example “Dog” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and Eats.\n","4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","  - Encapsulation and abstraction are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). As a result, they play an essential role in the design and structure of classes and objects.\n","    \n","    Encapsulation:\n","    Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. Direct access to some components of an object is restricted while controlled access is provided through methods. Objects should be designed to hide the internal implementation details and expose only what is needed to interact with them from the outside.\n","    \n","    In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers like private ('__') and protected ('_') to control the visibility of attributes and methods. However, Python enforces access control through convention rather than strict enforcement.\n","\n","    Abstraction:\n","    Abstraction, on the other hand, is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It helps manage complexity by separating what an object does (methods) from how it achieves it (implementation details).\n","\n","    In Python, abstraction is often achieved through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs define a common interface that subclasses are expected to implement. This allows you to specify what methods must be present in a class without providing a complete implementation.\n","5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","  - Dunder methods (short for Double UNDERscore) are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with two underscores, like: __init__, __str__, __add__, __len__, __eq__. These methods allow you to customize the behavior of objects and make your classes work more naturally with Python features, operators, and functions.\n","6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","  - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or base class). In this article, we'll explore inheritance in Python.\n","7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It refers to the ability of an entity (like a function or object) to perform different actions based on the context.Technically, in Python, polymorphism allows same method, function or operator to behave differently depending on object it is working with. This makes code more flexible and reusable.\n","8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - Encapsulation in Python is about protecting internal data of an object and exposing only what’s necessary through a controlled interface (methods/properties). Although Python doesn’t enforce strict access control like Java or C++, it uses conventions and name mangling to achieve encapsulation.\n","9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - Python constructor is an instance method in a class, that is automatically called whenever a new object of the class is created. The constructor's role is to assign value to instance variables as soon as the object is declared. Python uses a special method called __init__() to initialize the instance variables for the object, as soon as it is declared.\n","10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - A Python class method is a method that is bound to the class and not to the instance of the class. It can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. Most of us often get class methods confused with static methods. Always remember, while both are called on the class, static methods do not have access to the \"cls\" parameter and therefore it cannot modify the class state.\n","    In Python, a static method is a type of method that does not require any instance to be called. It is very similar to the class method but the difference is that the static method doesn't have a mandatory argument like reference to the object − self or reference to the class − cls. Static methods are used to access static fields of a given class. They cannot modify the state of a class since they are bound to the class, not instance.\n","11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Method overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. To overload method, we must change the number of parameters or the type of parameters, or both. Unlike other programming languages like Java, C++, and C#, Python does not support the feature of method overloading by default. However, there are alternative ways to achieve it.\n","12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  - The Python method overriding refers to defining a method in a subclass with the same name as a method in its superclass. In this case, the Python interpreter determines which method to call at runtime based on the actual object being referred to.\n","13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - The property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that allows you to use methods as attributes while still controlling how data is accessed or modified. It is commonly used to implement encapsulation in an elegant and Pythonic way.\n","14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism is one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming — and it’s extremely important because it enables flexibility, reusability, and extensibility in software design. Polymorphism means many forms — a single interface can represent different underlying forms (objects). Different classes can define the same method name, but each provides its own behavior.\n","15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow us to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n","16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  - Advantages of OOPs:\n","      - We can build the programs from standard working modules that communicate with one another, rather than having to start writing the code from scratch which leads to saving of development time and higher productivity,\n","      - OOP language allows to break the program into the bit-sized problems that can be solved easily (one object at a time).\n","      - The new technology promises greater programmer productivity, better quality of software and lesser maintenance cost.\n","      - OOP systems can be easily upgraded from small to large systems.\n","      - It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference,\n","      - It is very easy to partition the work in a project based on objects.\n","      - It is possible to map the objects in problem domain to those in the program.\n","      - The principle of data hiding helps the programmer to build secure programs which cannot be invaded by the code in other parts of the program.\n","      - By using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code and extend the use of existing classes.\n","      - Message passing techniques is used for communication between objects which makes the interface descriptions with external systems much simpler.\n","      - The data-centered design approach enables us to capture more details of model in an implementable form.\n","17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  - Instance Variable: It is basically a class variable without a static modifier and is usually shared by all class instances. Across different objects, these variables can have different values. They are tied to a particular object instance of the class, therefore, the contents of an instance variable are totally independent of one object instance to others.\n","  \n","    Class Variable: It is basically a static variable that can be declared anywhere at class level with static. Across different objects, these variables can have only one value. These variables are not tied to any particular object of the class, therefore, can share across all objects of the class.\n","18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  - Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a single class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This can be used when you want to get the functionality of multiple classes into a single class.\n","19. Explain the purpose of ''__str__' and '__repr__'' methods in Python\n","  - __str__() provides a readable, user-friendly string representation of an object, used by print() and str().\n","\n","    __repr__() provides an unambiguous, developer-oriented string representation, used for debugging and by repr() or the interactive interpreter.\n","20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n","  - the super() function is used to call methods from a parent (superclass) inside a child (subclass). It allows you to extend or override inherited methods while still reusing the parent's functionality. No need to hardcode parent class names – useful when class hierarchies change. Works with single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance. Improves code reusability and maintainability. Prevents duplicate initialization in complex hierarchies.\n","21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n","22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - The difference between the Class method and the static method is:\n","\n","      - A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n","      - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it.\n","      - In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n","      - We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.\n","23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows a subclass to override a method from its parent class so that the same method call on different objects behaves differently depending on the object's actual type. This is also called runtime polymorphism or method overriding.\n","\n","    In Python, polymorphism with inheritance occurs when a subclass overrides a method from its base class, allowing the same method call to behave differently based on the object's actual type. This enables flexibility and reusability in OOP.\n","24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single statement by having each method return the object (self). It creates a smooth and readable flow of operations on the same object. This is achieved by making each method return the object itself (usually return self).\n","25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method in Python allows an object to be called like a function.\n","If a class defines __call__, then its instances can be invoked using parentheses, just like calling a function."],"metadata":{"id":"voWqzhpgfe_x"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Practical Questions:\n","# 1.
